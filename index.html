        <h1>First Post</h1>
        <p>
            My best classroom computing experience so far would be working on the final project assignment for Artificial Intelligence last semester. The final project was based on the programming game "Robot Game." We had created a robot for this game early in the
            semester but it only worked programattically. Now we had to accomplish the same goal by teaching a bot how to play the game through deep learning. The project was very frustrating at first because it seemed like no matter what I tried the
            robot would not learn anything significant. It took a full two weeks of trying different approaches before my bot had any progress in learning how to play the game. The feeling when I saw the robot play the game correctly and actually kind
            of well was extremely satisfying since I felt like I had actually learned something. <br> &emsp; Outside of the classroom the first thing that comes to mind is my research into Optical Wireless Communication (OWC) under Dr. Hamza.
            I have really enjoyed working on this project because it was so challenging. The purpose of this research is to find alternatives to radio frequencies for transmitting information. In this project I'm trying to find a low cost solution to
            this problem by transmitting a signal through LED's controlled by an arduino and a camera that picks up the transmission. The idea is that the light flickers really fast and the camera should be able to pick up on a message by how the light
            flashes. In practice this proved to be really difficult since the synchronization between the flicker of the light and the frames per second on the camera had to very precise. A few months ago I finally succeeded with a workable version of
            the project and although it still has room for improvement I was very proud in getting it to work.

        <h1>Reflection on Ethcis</h1>
        <p>
            My overall impression of the ethics discussion was that it seems that on average we all sort of value the same things. This makes sense since it is nice for a society to have similar values. It makes even more sense when you think about the fact that
            we all are about the same age had mostly similar upbringings and share a common education in a common area. I'm sure the answers would have had more variety if there was more variety in age and people of different areas.
            <br> &emsp; I thought it was interesting that a lot of people alluded to the religion they had or were exposed to growing up. It seemed like several people no longer practiced the religion they were exposed to and some outright rejected it
            now. In my opinion I think you can learn a lot of good things from following a religion but at the same time there are people out there who take advantage of their followers. I think if practiced well even if you don't believe in it you can
            learn a lot from a religion.

        <h1>Hive Tracks and Bee Informed Partnership</h1>
        <p>
            I think that this discussion ended up in the same area that most tech discussions lead to these days. Since there has been so much advancement and change in technology recently it is hard for legislation and regulation to keep up. I think this has a lot
            to do with people making legislation not really growing up with these issues and having to learn stuff on the fly. The main issues of how to handle people's information is still a fairly new concept. There is a lot to consider with keeping
            it safe, keeping it anonymous, and allowing the users to have control over it. There isn't as much concern for an app like Hive Tracks since it is such a niche market but in a more generalized market like Google and Facebook it is a huge issue.
            These companies have gone from services to advertising companies in the past few years and have essentially turned is into the product. These issues make me kind of worried about what is to come if we don't control what companies can do with
            our data.

        <h1>Privacy Policy Reflection</h1>
        <p>
            What was interesting to me about the privacy policy I read was that it was pretty easy to understand compared to other legal documents I've looked at. That combined with the fact that Google was pretty upfront about the kind of data they were collecting.
            There was some language in the policy I read and others we spoke about that does make me uncomfortable. Language that is obviously ambiguous does make you think a little bit more about what these companies are doing with our data. I've never
            been a huge fan of social media to begin with so I thought I was safe from a lot of data collection. It wasn't until recently that I learned that Google and YouTube, services I use often, were some of the worst offenders for data collection.
            Because of this I've started using some different browsers and cutting back on YouTube. I really don't like the idea of someone looking over my shoulder all the time so I want to do all I can to ensure my privacy is protected.

        <h1>Citizen Four Docmuentary</h1>
        <p>
            I thought that the Citizen Four documentary was pretty unnerving. I had actually listened to a podcast before that had Edward Snowden on it several years ago where he was talking about the things he exposed in the documentary. Even still it was pretty
            crazy to me the lengths he went through to not be discovered as the person leaking this information. I think it is a terrible thing to have to live in fear that everything you are doing is being monitored. It does not make me feel safer in
            the slightest that the NSA has all this power. Maybe it has helped them stop some bad things from happening but this is not for certain and even then it is a very slippery slope. Even though we know now what the NSA is doing and is capable
            of it doesn't seem like reform to that is coming anytime soon. I like what Edward Snowden did to expose the government but it was all a waste of time if no change comes from it.
        </p>
        <h1>Blockchain discussion</h1>
        <p>
            I enjoyed learning more about how blockchain actually works under the hood. The idea that you could have something that is both public and private at the same time in the way that the ledger of all transactions is public but who is actually making the
            transactions is completely anonymous. It was cool to see all the different ways people are trying to leverage blockchain technology. In some of the use cases it seems like people are trying a little too hard to use blockchain but I feel like
            some cases will stick. I truly wonder if we are heading to a completely decentralized currency where government has no control over it. The idea of decentralization is pretty scary on the surface but I think it could lead to some good outcomes.
        </p>

        <h1>Final Topics</h1>
        <p>
            Of the final topics I heard I was pretty interested in the one about games that profit off micro-transactions. Even though it probably is not that big of deal in the grand scheme of things, micro-transactions have become a really annoying part of life
            for anyone that plays video games. It could be nostalgia but I feel like video games when I was growing up were a lot more pure. It seemed like older games were just trying to be fun so that people would buy them. Now developers have made
            it to where they just annoy the hell out of you so you spend money or make the game impossible without spending money. It feels like the gaming industry has become sleezy with these business models and it feels like it's ruining part of the
            gaming world.

        <h1>Final Blog Post</h1>
        <p>
            Three things I learned from this class:
            1. I learned a good bit about blockchain technology. I had never really researched this topic that much on my own but had been hearing it everywhere. I never fully understood what it was and what it was being used for until this class. I still don't really understand
            some of the things people are trying to do with blockchain though. Some things like NFTs seem pretty silly to me, but I think there are some good things that can come from blockchain applications.

            2. This class kept me updated with current events that I'm sure that I would have missed if I had not been in this class. I'm usually pretty terrible about keeping up with things that are going on in the outside world. I'm not sure if this is for better or for worse 
            but it did expand my horizons a bit.

            3. I learned that no amount of classes you take are going to prepare you for actually getting and working a job. Classes can stear you in the right direction but if you don't decide to actually do something about it you are never going to get anywhere.

            The piece of advice I would give to other people taking this class is to start the job search early. Worry more about finding a job because that is the whole reason you are in college and classes are just a way to get there.
